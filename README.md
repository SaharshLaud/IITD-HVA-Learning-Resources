# IITD-HVA-Learning-Resources
A repository consisting of the all the interesting learning material I found useful for gaining knowledge as a new HVA student at IIT Delhi.
The aim of this repository is to share useful links, books, tutorials, courses, Youtube videos and any resource that can assist in gaining knowledge and work more efficiently in the assigned laboratory.
This repo also aims to share the material with other studets who might come in the successive batches and other people in the lab if they need any assistance in some topic whose resources are available in this repository.
